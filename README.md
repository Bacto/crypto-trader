## cryptotrader

It's just some experiments I share with friends that want to learn JS :)

How to start the bot:

1. Get and install NodeJS
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP archive
1. Create a bot on Telegram (contact @botfather)
1. Create a file `.env` (see "Create the .env file")
1. Install needed packages: `npm install`
1. Start the bot: `npm run start`


### Create the .env file

You should create the `.env` file at the root of the project (in the cryptoTrader directory).

This file will contain all the secrets.

Example:

```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<bot_token>
TELEGRAM_USERNAME=<bot_username>
```
